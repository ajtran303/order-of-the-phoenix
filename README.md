# Order of the Phoenix

### Background

In the Harry Potter book series, students attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the ways of Witches and Wizards. Each student at the school belongs to one of four "houses": Griffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin.

The Order Of The Phoenix was a secret society founded by Albus Dumbledore to oppose the evil Lord Voldemort and his minions, the Death Eaters. The original Order was created in the 1970s. ... The Order disbanded but was reconvened in 1995 after Harry Potter informed Dumbledore of Lord Voldemort's return.
